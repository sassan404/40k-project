# 40k-project


Welcome to my Project about the 40k warhammer universe


The aim of this project is to make a website that can serve as an archive to 40k informations, where searching and finding informations about any subject 40k related is easy and fun.


On the other hand this is my first project to ever br made, I'm using it to learn programming and web design, so it might take long time to get finished, or even be presentable.


Technologies used in this project:
- Angular for front-end
- Asp.net core and c# for back-end


Notes:
- please be patient and dont explode if you see something you dont like, I'm still learning
- if you read something and find out i need to change something, do it better, or add a feature, please let me know
- again please be friendly and patient, I'm only learning



This is the 40st millenia and there is only war
